# Copper_Utilization

The Copper Cut plan program is a Streamlit-based web application designed to automate and optimize copper bar cutting from MIPs. 

The program extracts part data from engineering drawing PDFs using OpenAI's GPT-40 vision capabilities, classifies parts into categories (cuttable, KANBAN, and others) and generate optimized cut plans to minimize copper waste. The output included intereative visualization as well as downloadable CSV and PDF cut sheet.
